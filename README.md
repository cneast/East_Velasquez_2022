Files for â€‹Unintended Consequences of Immigration Enforcement: Household Services and High-Educated Mothers' Work

Updated 4.21.22 by Chloe N. East

The do files to replicate East and Velasquez (2022) are included in the Code folder. The numbered do files indicate the order in which they should be run. The do files that are not numbered will be called up in the numbered do files as needed. 

The Data folder includes two files. The first is the enforcement data set we use that contains information about SC, 287(g) agreements and E-Verify. See the paper for more details and sources. This is called "287g_SC_EVerify_1_31_22_cpuma0010". The second is an excel file that contains information on PUMA population that we use in the intensity and mechanisms analyses. This is called "CPUMA0010_summary". Due to restrictions on data sharing, we do not publish the ACS or TRAC data sets we use. The ACS data can be downloaded here: https://usa.ipums.org/usa/ Information about TRAC data licenses is here: https://trac.syr.edu/aboutTRACgeneral.html
